# Winters Rite

**1st Year University Project** <br/>
**Semester 2** <br/>
**Games Production**
 
 Winters Rite was a university group project.
 
 We were given a Game Design Idea and were tasked with Implementing it within a Group of Programmers and Designers.
 
 The Project was a great opportunity for me to explore previously unfamiliar areas (Networking for Example) as well as a way for me to become comfortable with Unity. Due to unforeseen circumstances the game did not reach a finished stage in which I was happy with however the quality and quantity of work in which I produced during the project is some of which I'm proud of.
 
 I was Primarily Responsible for the Programming of the Game however also took part in design discussions.
